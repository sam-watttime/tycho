# tycho-emissions

tycho is scope two emissions measurement data collection and modelling pipeline for python.

Tycho's ETL process includes:
* Fetching data from US regulatory reporting to geocode fossil fuel power plants.
* Querying google earth engine to fetch remote sensing (satellite) data from the European Space Agency's Sentinel sattelite program with emissions measurements for power plants. 

Tycho's modelling process includes:
* A robust XGBoost pipeline trained on measured US power plant emission reporting and Sentinel sattelite data, capable of making predictions of power plant emissions in the US or Internationally.
